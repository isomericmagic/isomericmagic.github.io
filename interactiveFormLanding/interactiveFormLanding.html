	    <h1>Building an Interactive Form</h1>
		<h3>Project Information</h3>
        <p>In this project, you'll create an interactive registration form for "FullStack Conf." Using the supplied HTML 
        and CSS files, you'll use JavaScript to enhance the form by adding interactivity. You'll also make the form 
        more user-friendly by providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form 
        fields. You can use plain JavaScript or jQuery, it's up to you!</p>
        <p>This project is a great way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. It also gives you a simple 
        interactive portfolio project you can use to show off your understanding of JavaScript. Forms are a large part 
        of any web application, so learning how to make them easy-to-use, interactive and responsive is a task worth 
        mastering.</p>

		<h3>Project Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
		  <li>When the page loads, give focus to the first text field.</li>
		  <li>A text field that will be revealed when the "Other" option is selected from the "Job Role" drop down menu.</li>
		  <li>Give the field an id of "other-title," and add the placeholder text of "Your Job Role" to the field.</li>
		  <li>For the T-Shirt color menu, only display the color options that match the design selected in the "Design" menu.</li>
		  <li>If the user selects the JS Puns theme, then the color menu should only display "Cornflower Blue," "Dark Slate Grey," and "Gold."</li>
		  <li>If the user selects the I heart JS theme, then the color menu should only display "Tomato," "Steel Blue," and "Dim Grey."</li>
		  <li>Some events are at the same time as others. If the user selects a workshop, don't allow selection of a workshop at the same 
		  date and time -- you should disable the checkbox and visually indicate that the workshop in the competing time slot isn't available.</li>
		  <li>When a user unchecks an activity, make sure that competing activities (if there are any) are no longer disabled.</li>
		  <li>As a user selects activities, a running total should display below the list of checkboxes. For example, if the user selects 
		  "Main Conference", then Total: $200 should appear. If they add 1 workshop, the total should change to Total: $300.</li>
		  <li>Display payment sections based on the payment option chosen in the select menu.</li>
		  <li>The "Credit Card" payment option should be selected by default, display the #credit-card div, and hide the "Paypal" and 
		  "Bitcoin information.</li>
		  <li>When a user selects the "PayPal" payment option, the Paypal information should display, and the credit card and "Bitcoin" 
		  information should be hidden.</li>
		  <li>When a user selects the "Bitcoin" payment option, the Bitcoin information should display, and the credit card and "PayPal" 
		  information should be hidden.</li>
		  <li>If any of the following validation errors exist, prevent the user from submitting the form:</li>
		  <ul>
			<li>Name field can't be blank.</li>
			<li>Email field must be a validly formatted e-mail address (you don't have to check that it's a real e-mail address, 
			just that it's formatted like one: dave@teamtreehouse.com for example).</li>
			<li>Must select at least one checkbox under the "Register for Activities" section of the form.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li>If the selected payment option is "Credit Card," make sure the user has supplied a credit card number, a zip code, and a 3 number 
		  CVV value before the form can be submitted.</li>
		  <ul>
			<li>Credit card field should only accept a number between 13 and 16 digits.</li>
			<li>The zipcode field should accept a 5-digit number.</li>
			<li>The CVV should only accept a number that is exactly 3 digits long.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li>Provide some kind of indication when there's a validation error. The field's borders could turn red, for example, or a message could 
		  appear near the field or at the top of the form.</li>
		  <li>There should be an error indication for the name field, email field, "Register for Activities" checkboxes, credit card number, zip 
		  code, and CVV.</li>
		  <li>When JavaScript is switched off or unavailable, the user should still have access to all form fields and payment information. For 
		  example, the "Other" text field in the "Job Role" menu should be visible on the page when JavaScript is switched off, and all 
		  information for Bitcoin, Paypal or Credit Card payments should be visible.</li>		  
		</ol>
