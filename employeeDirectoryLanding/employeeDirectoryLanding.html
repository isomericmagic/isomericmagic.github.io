	    <h1>Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory</h1>
		<h3>Project Information</h3>
        <p>Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information 
        quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media 
        and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.</p>
        <p>Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way to for employees to share 
        contact information with each other. In this project, you'll use the Random User Generator API (<a href="https://randomuser.me/"></a>) 
        to grab information for 12 random "employees", and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. You'll 
        request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, 
        email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the 
        employee's birthday and address.</p>
        <p>You will need to create everything (all the html, css and javascript) for this project on your own, and the end result should look like 
        the example photos provided in the employee_directory_v1 folder. Feel free to use jQuery for this project.</p>

		<h3>Project Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Using photos and information that the API provides, you'll display 12 users, along with some basic information:</li>
            <ul>
          	  <li>Image</li>
          	  <li>First and Last Name</li>
          	  <li>Email</li>
          	  <li>City</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user's row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:</li>
            <ul>
          	  <li>Image</li>
          	  <li>Name</li>
          	  <li>Username</li>
          	  <li>Email</li>
          	  <li>Cell Number</li>
          	  <li>Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code.</li>
          	  <li>Birthdate</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Display the users in a grid or table.</li>
              <li>Add a hover state to the rows of the user table. </li>
              <li>Make sure there's a way to close the modal window.</li>
            </ul>
